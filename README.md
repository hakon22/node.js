## with React/React-Router/Redux-Toolkit, Bootstrap, Express/PostgreSQL

The project consists of two backends, one written in JS, the second in TypeScript.

The frontend is written in React TypeScript.

The project provides the opportunity to create a user with his personal page.

When a user is created/changed, a log of actions is recorded.

On the log page you can sort the list by user id.

For convenience, the list is divided into pages with Boostrap pagination.
